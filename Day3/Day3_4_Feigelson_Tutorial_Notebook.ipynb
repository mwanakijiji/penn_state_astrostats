    "We start by running one of the most widely used functions in R, _lm_ for linear modeling, and related procedures. But vefore we start, it is important to note that, in statistical parlance, 'linear' refers to a much broader range of models than $Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon$.  It includes any model that is linear in the model **parameters**.  Thus the following models are 'linear' and an encompassed by the powerful theorems underlying linear modeling:\n",
    "- $Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\beta_2 X^2 + \\epsilon$ (polynomial)\n",

    "- $Y = [\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X for X < \\beta_2] and [\\beta_3 + \\beta_4 X for X > \\beta_2]$ segmented linear\n",

The most important is a nonparametric two-sample test between the cumulative distribution functions of the observed and fitted values of the response variable. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is commonly used, but the Cramer-von Mises and Anderson-Darling tests are more sensitive.   However, theorems show that tabulated probabilities are inapplicable when the second distribution is from a model based on the first distribution.  We thus use bootstrap replications to estimate probabilities. This capability is provided by CRAN package 'cramer' for the Cramer-von Mises test.
